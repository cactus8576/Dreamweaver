    <h1>AUGUST BLOG 2022</h1>
    <p>Video Games can be entertaining as a player, competitor and a spectator. The appeal of video games is that they can be tuned to any type of audience. There is a game out there for everyone to enjoy. If you seek competition there are several titles that offer hard-core competitive edge to enjoy. The uniqueness of games can bring people in and interested. The concept of video games being a spectator sport is strange but what the communities bring together can be amazing with production, organization and competition can really make the aspect of watching games more appealing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Video games act as a gateway into another world away from modern society. This chance that gives people to drift away for a bit into another world benefits the mental fortitude of the person. Video games also bring shifts into society with pop culture and those aspects. With games its another outlook on life and it helps people relax and find an escape and thats how its so powerful in society. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I played xenoblade chronicles 1 . it's an open world rpg with a very heavy story based. I chose it because I like RPGs and the story elements seemed appealing to me and I wanted to play a big series. It has a unique combat system compared to turn based rpgs where you can attack at anytime and move around the battlefield and attack. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp; I sat down at the small blue chair and prepared my settings for my match. Selected the stage battlefield of course and got to the character select screen. The lighting on the room grew dim in the little corner of the switch games. All the yellow character icons lit up the screen greatly. I selected a favorite of mine pokemon trainer, who can control 3 separate pokemon. My opponent picked shulk a swordsman who can change stat altering effects on himself to deal greater results. We pressed start and got into the match.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;What game will you choose for your coaching project? Why that game? I'll be choosing to smash ultimate as my project focus. I am a competitor in the game and my scene for it I have a great interest in how the big organizations treat it. Team Liquid is one of the biggest and most recognizable organizations in the scene. With them having many top 10 players under their belt.</p>

  <h2>September BLOG</h2>
  <p dir="ltr">The social media use is Twitter, Instagram and youtube/twitch. I use Twitter to keep up on current events and find artwork I like. I use it to keep up in my competitive scene for smash. It makes me happy as I am active in the scene I love. Instagram is for more personal matters like IRL friends and people I know. Seeing everyone's posts or stories brings entertainment. Youtube I consume usually in the background while doing something else as it acts as a relaxant for me or informational if I'm willing to learn.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What Conclusion can you draw from these stats? : A alot of people use it to feel more connected with their friends and helps people be more social even with it is online.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;How do they compare to your personal experience?:&nbsp; I relate to being more connected with my friends and i have people who support me online.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Video: Active use is generally happy and Passive use is depressed use.&nbsp; Social media is exaggerated media. Lots of studies on how it affects kids' minds and perceptions of the real world.</p>

  <p dir="ltr">They video shows a complete understanding of the mechanic being used and teaches the proper way to input it into their own gameplay.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;They do a pretty solid job so I wouldn't really change anything but I can learn a lot from this tutorial if I was a beginner in the game.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;With Clips and Recordings if I can get used to having a clear tone when describing tech I will have a better chance of reaching the viewer. .</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One of the best moves to use in smash ultimate is pretty simple and it's the shield button. The shield button is often overlooked and not used but it is in my opinion the best move to use. It is used to block attacks and counter-attack opponents for hitting you putting you into an advantage state.&nbsp; All characters have an out-of-shield move which will be good to use after dropping your shield. Although it is a very strong tool if you use it too much the opponent can catch on. This can result in your shield being grabbed, poked, or even broken. So make sure to use it to bait out attacks and hard commitment from the other player.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What branch would i want to enter for esports. That would be the Production or organization/content creation branch on the graph. I love broadcasting and production so getting the opportunity to work in that field would be amazing. Creating a wonderful production with high-quality materials and equipment would be great. Creating atmospheres that appeal to the community and crafting everything behind the scenes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
