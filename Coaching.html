    <h1>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&nbsp;</h1>
    <h1>Rated E for everyone</h1>
    <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
    <p>Super smash Brothers Ultimate is my choice for esports title and a great platform fighter to play</p>
    <p>The game is all about characters with over 90&nbsp;characters! There exists a very steep learning curve with mechanics and learing alot of the matchups. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Smash Ultimate pros tend to practice with players among their skill levels. Finding partners who will grind the game and practice for hours learning and growing with each game. Coaches are usually meant to help point out flaws in their player's gameplay and figure out exploits on their opponent's behalf. Another thing you can use to get coaching tips is by asking what you did wrong and what you can improve on after facing an opponent even if you won.&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Fundamentals are the core of smash ultimate. Knowing what moves to use in each scenario you are put in will help you win. Using your shield and grab for optimal call-outs or punishes help reward you more than just mashing attack buttons.&nbsp; There are lots of playstyles that you can adopt such as, Bait and Punish, Rush down, or Camping. These are something that you can focus on after gaining the &quot;Fundies&quot; to compliment the styles. Some examples of professional players and their playstyles are. &quot;Light&quot; and his Fox play very aggressively and rush down their opponents. While &quot;Dabuz's&quot; Rosalina or Olimar are more patient and camp the opponent out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
